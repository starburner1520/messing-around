# messing-around

(Bing-bong.)

Ladies and gentlemen, First Officer Richardson again. 
As you know, here at Unbeaten Track, it’s our pleasure to provide you with a short talk or anecdote ...

Douglas, no!

... from one of the crew with particular knowledge of the region. In this case, I’d like to invite Captain duCref ...

Please!

... to share with you the enthralling story of how he once encountered a polar bear 
in the wild and outwitted it armed only with – if I recall correctly – an egg whisk and a pogo stick. 
Ladies and gentlemen, your captain!

(terrible French accent): 

... ’Allo. Well ... I don’t like to talk about zis.

But you’ve agreed to now! We’re most honoured! So, when did it happen?

Uh ... when I was in ze French Foreign Legion.

Ah, the regiment famous for being non-Frenchmen.

Yes. For me they made ze exception ... because I am not entirely French, in fact, I’m half-English – more than half, 
actually, so anyway, we were stationed in Alaska ...

Unusual for a desert regiment.

Yes, it was unusual. We wanted to ’ave ... ze element of surprise. Anyway, I saw a polar bear, so I called out to my comrades ...

What did you call out?

... ‘Look out! A polar bear!’

Only you said it in French.

Of course I said it in French then. I do not say it in French now because ... no-one would understand me.

But, just out of interest, what is ‘polar bear’ in French?

It is, in fact, the same as in English.

Really? ‘Polar bear’?

Yes. It is a word we have borrowed from your langwaj. Only, of course, we say ‘bear polar’.

I see. So you saw the polar bear, you called out, ‘Attention, mes amis! Regardez-vous le bear polar!’ And then what?

Then I put the egg whisk into the snowdrift, whisked it up like a blizzard in the bear’s face, 
then under cover of his confusion, I bounced away on the pogo stick. Zhank you, goodbye.
